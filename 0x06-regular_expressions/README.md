A regular expression (often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp") is a pattern that specifies a set of strings. It's a powerful tool for text processing and manipulation, allowing you to perform tasks like searching, matching, and extracting information from text based on specific patterns or rules.

Regular expressions consist of a combination of ordinary characters (letters, digits, symbols) and special metacharacters that have special meanings. They enable you to define complex patterns for matching text. Some common uses for regular expressions include:

Pattern Matching: You can use regular expressions to search for specific patterns within a larger text. For example, finding all email addresses or phone numbers in a document.

Text Validation: Regular expressions are often used to validate user input, such as checking if an email address, phone number, or credit card number is in the correct format.

Data Extraction: You can extract specific information from structured data, such as parsing data from log files or extracting content between HTML tags in a web page.

Text Transformation: Regular expressions can be used for text replacement and transformation. For example, you can replace all occurrences of one word with another, or you can reformat text in a consistent way.

Tokenization: Regular expressions are used in natural language processing for tokenizing text, separating it into individual words or phrases.

String Manipulation: Regular expressions are widely used for string manipulation tasks, including removing unwanted characters, formatting text, and more
