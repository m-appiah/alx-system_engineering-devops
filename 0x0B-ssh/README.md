SSH stands for Secure Shell. It's a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two systems. SSH is commonly used to access and manage remote machines or servers securely over an unsecured network, like the internet.

It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the client and server. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to verify the user's identity securely without sending passwords in plain text over the network.

SSH is widely used for various purposes, including remote command-line access, file transfer (using tools like SCP or SFTP), and tunneling various types of network connections to securely access services on remote networks.
