HTTP SSL, often referred to as HTTPS (HTTP Secure), is a combination of two protocols: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security). HTTPS is used to secure communication over the Internet by encrypting the data transmitted between a web server and a web client (typically a web browser).

Here's a brief overview of each component:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. However, HTTP by itself does not provide any security mechanisms, and data transmitted over HTTP is sent in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.

SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security): SSL and its successor TLS are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. They establish an encrypted link between a web server and a web client, ensuring that data exchanged between them remains confidential and cannot be tampered with. SSL/TLS uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques to achieve this.

When HTTP is combined with SSL/TLS, it forms HTTPS. Here's how it works:

When a client (such as a web browser) initiates a connection to a server (such as a website), it requests a secure connection using HTTPS.
The server responds by sending its SSL/TLS certificate to the client, which contains its public key and other information.
The client verifies the server's certificate and establishes a secure connection with the server.
All data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted and decrypted using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
