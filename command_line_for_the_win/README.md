Command line for the win tasks solution

Transferring files from a local Windows machine to a remote server using SFTP via the Windows Command Prompt involves several steps. To do this, you can use the sftp command-line client, which is included with the OpenSSH client package on Windows. Here's the process:

Open Command Prompt:
On your local Windows machine, open the Command Prompt. You can do this by searching for "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar.

Navigate to the Local Directory:
Use the cd command to navigate to the local directory on your Windows machine that contains the file you want to upload.

Initiate the SFTP Session:
To initiate an SFTP session, you can use the sftp command followed by the username and hostname of the remote server.

Authenticate:
Depending on your server's configuration, you'll be prompted to enter the password or, if you've set up SSH key authentication, you might need to provide the passphrase for your private key.

Navigate to the Remote Directory:
Once you're connected, navigate to the remote directory where you want to upload the file using the cd command.

Upload the File:
Use the put command to upload the file from your local Windows machine to the remote server.

Confirm the Transfer:
The put command will display the progress of the transfer and inform you when it's complete. Ensure that the file has been successfully uploaded.
Exit SFTP:

You can exit the SFTP session by using the exit command.
